# To do List App

# Overview
	The project acts as a to do list, built on c# alongside SQLite. C# communicates to the database via a package, Microsoft.Data.SQLite.

	Data is already created within seed.sql, formatted via schema.sql, allowing for usable data for the program
# What i learnt
	I've learned a lot from this project, as it's my first time building a project with not only 2 programming langauges, but also communication between them.
	I've also learned about other ways of storing data outside of a file, such as with SQL. Not only this but choosing the right type of SQL for the project was important.
	SQLite was chosen due to being lightweight and serverless, allowing me to get back into understanding SQL without any complexities.
